# Smart-Helmet
  One accident occurs every two minutes in India, according to estimates. This is due to not wearing a helmet and not receiving sufficient medical assistance following an accident. Using innovative technologies to lower the number of accidents while also attempting to prevent them. We created a "Smart Helmet" that assures the riders' safety by requiring them to wear a helmet.
  
  In the event of an accident, a helmet protects the rider. A Smart Helmet is a protective headgear worn by a rider that makes riding a bike safer than it was previously. This version of the concept has been enhanced with advanced features such as alcohol detection, location tracking, and accident detection, as well as the ability to use it as a hands-free device and fall detection. It is mandatory for a rider to wear a helmet; otherwise, the bike will not start until the helmet sends a signal. The communication between the bike and the rider is enabled by an NRF module. If a rider becomes inebriated during the journey, the helmet detects this and sends a message to the rider, as well as turning off the ignition. If a bike rider is in trouble due to an accident or another circumstance, the rider's location and bike can be tracked, and a message with the rider's location can be sent.
